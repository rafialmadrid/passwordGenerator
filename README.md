1. The first part of this code was to do the logic behind the input for the character length of the password. In order to achieve this, I coded a logic to validate the number range and the type of the input. I did this using a while statement so the user is only allowed to go on if all the conditions are satisfied.
2. The second part of my code is basically an if statement for each different case where the user selected different combinations and each of them has a for statement that will generate the password using the criteria the user defined with the prompt. For this part I had to use the random function around arrays.
